QUIZ APP


DIRECTION:
This is a Basic Quiz app which is going to test your basic General knowledge. You can start by clicking on "START QUIZ" after Entering your name in the Text Field.

TECHNOLOGY: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and React JS.

I started Learning React JS and tried to implement my basic learnings into building this Quiz App.
I used React State Hooks to manage and display the Content/Informations on UI.
